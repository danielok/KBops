ITZY have released their 2nd Japan album 'Collector', featuring a mix of new Japanese songs and Japanese versions of some of their other songs. Despite the name, 'Rock & Roll', is a dance-pop song. This track has a characteristic ITZY catchy, high-energy chorus. (Makes me think that a megamix of ITZY choruses could be an absolute banger of a DJ set)  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPQniD4MB0w">Watch on YouTube</a>.
