As teased two weeks ago, we have 'Different' from Le Sserafim. A bit of a change up from their usual style, 
this one lowers the tempo and raises the groove. Strong drums, bright guitars and a brass section make this a funk masterpiece.

Many people have mentioned that this is the most Nile Rogers-like track in K-pop even though 
he didnâ€™t work on this one (he previously worked on their song 'Unforgiven').
'Different' has to be LE SSERAFIM's funkiest song so far. 
(Arachnophobia warning for the music video though.)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFZUAXhdnHk">Watch on YouTube</a>
