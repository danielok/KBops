Well, 2025 is wrapping up, and there have been so many fantastic songs released this year. I thought I'd have a shot at listing my favourite 5, as well as some favourite throwback tracks that have featured the blog this year.

## 1. Love 2 - BB Girls

This magical k-city pop song has been my top played track on YT Music this year, for good reason. Its sweet, sombre and optimistic vibe blesses my ears every time I listen to it

## 2. Different - LE SSERAFIM

The funkiest track of the year, brought to you by the queens of cool - Le Sserafim. This is a Japanese single, but also has an English version. Criminal that it's only 2:23 long. 

## 3. ShaLaLa - SAYMYNAME

This one is a cheerful and upbeat track blending k-city pop and synth pop. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face.

## 4. I want you - SMORZ

Sugary sweet bubblegum pop from Smorz.

## 5. This is For - TWICE

Twice never stop evolving, and This is For is another new sound from them. Powerful but groovy this one definitely gave me goosebumps when they opened with it at their live concert I saw in Melbourne. Twice never disappoints. 

## Honourable Mention: Be Alright - IVE

IVE once again hit us with an apologetic banger! This powerful dance track one from their Japanese release packs a punch!

## Older Tracks

*Off the record - IVE* Defies genre definitions, but is has moderate tempo, richly produced sound with a great hip hop rap.

*Green light - BoA* Lovely city pop style track from the legendary BoA.
