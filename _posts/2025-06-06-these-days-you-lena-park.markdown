This week we take things back in time again with a song from Lena Park released in 1998. “These Days You (요즘 넌...)” This song has some classic 90’s swinging drums and a tasty organ intro and muted trumpet outro. Effortlessly groovy. The song title has really helped me remember the word for “recently / these days” (pronounced yoo-jum). <a href="https://youtu.be/GduTZPYApPU">Watch on YouTube</a>

Here’s 'It's Me': another one of her songs which is reminiscent of “Together Again” by Janet Jackson. <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=GgcT1aLssHs">Watch on YouTube Music</a>

Harp, clavinet, and  a dance beat: check.
