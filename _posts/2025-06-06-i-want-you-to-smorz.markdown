This week we address the age-old philosophical question: Is it still K-Pop if the group members are from Hong Kong and the lyrics are all English? After listening to this debut track from the brand new group Smorz (May 2025), I think you’ll agree with me the answer is an emphatic yes.

'I want you to' has all the key features of a classic K-Pop track: upbeat tempo, rhythmic vocals, and a brightly colourful, well-choregraphed music video. Key highlights include the detuned filter sweep in the intro, the lyric syncopation for “Ti-i-i-ime”, “dance mhm dance, put this song on repeat” on the off-beat, and most importantly the producer resisting the temptation to do the tired nu-disco trope of having the synth stabs on every on-beat. The synth in the chorus is on beats 1 and 2, and the “and of 3” then a rest. Apologies in advance for every song I’ve now ruined because you will notice the synth stabs on all four beats of the bar, which this song successfully avoids.

Minor nitpick, I think the lyric “so slow, like a criminal” could have been “so slow, it’s criminal”. Put otherwise I’d say this is K-Pop perfection. I do respect the healthy boundaries though, as they are only asking for the target of their affection to “give me your weekends,” not every day.
