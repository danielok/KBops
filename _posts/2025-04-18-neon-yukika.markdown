Today’s track is from Yukika, a Japanese K-Pop solo artist. She’s been a major influence in the popularisation of City Pop into Korean music. This song is 'Neon' and is probably her best known K-City Pop song. It’s a moody dance/City Pop track with a dual timeline music video, with 80s flashbacks very much a tribute to original City Pop artists like Mariya Takeuchi and Miki Matsubara. It makes clever use of 4:3 and 16:9 to show a contemporary young boy’s discovery of City Pop. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67jSYCSrnE4">Watch on YouTube</a>
