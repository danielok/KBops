Time for a feel-good track from the one of stars of the first generation of K-Pop. BoA (Korean name: Kwon Bo-ah) is known as the Queen of K-Pop, for good reason: she has an extensive catalog from 2000 onwards, spanning many different pop, R&B, and ballad styles (including 'Garden in the Air' which I'd argue is even acid jazz!). 'Green Light' from 2015 is a particularly uplifting city-pop adjacent track. It's not the top most-played lists from her prolific career but is still a beautiful song. Starting with mellow strings and piano, as soon as the guitar and drums start you know you have to wind down in the window in your 1990s convertible, and cruise down the freeway (as is the case for all good city pop songs!). This one has a particularly tasty strings arrangement between the chorus and the second verse. Each part of the song steadily builds upon the momentum of the previous, until you realise you're bopping your head along and need to check the speedometer in the aforementioned convertible, to make sure you're not driving too fast! Take a listen to this track and then explore the other amazing songs on the album 'Kiss My Lips' that BoA wrote and produced herself (Other highlights include: Fox, Smash, and Double Jack). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkWb32WG8Xw">Watch on YouTube</a>.
