This week prepare your heart and ears for an rich dose of bubblegum pop from Hearts2Hearts. 'Pretty Please' takes a new jack swing vibe and turns up the catchiness and sugar levels to 11. This song rivals SayMyName's 'ShaLala' for the bubbliest song on the blog so far. The overall cuteness is balanced by the driving groove, and a contrasting bridge. Even with just a handful of releases Hearts2Hearts have explored several different genres and it will be interesting to see how their future releases evolve. Anyway, today's song 'Pretty Please' will put a smile on your face, and a cheer in your heart, and has a suitably delightful MV: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufwB9Uja_wM">Watch on YouTube</a>.
