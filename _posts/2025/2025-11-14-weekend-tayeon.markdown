K-Pop legend Tayeon has a huge catalog of amazing songs - both solo records and tracks with Girls' Generation. This week we've got a highlight from 2021. 'Weekend' is the epitome of K-City Pop. Tayeon's vocal talents are clear with her singing and rapping on this song, and she perfectly captures the weekend vibes of the track. The arrangement is on the funkier side of city pop bright guitars and synth sounds round out the sound, and the steady rhythm gives both and upbeat and laidback feel at the same time. The music video is cheerful and colourful - well lots of different shades of the colour pink anyway - and captures the mood of the song perfectly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmuL-BPFi2Q">Watch on YouTube</a>.
