Marina Saito brings us a glorious contemporary city pop song 'Crazy for you' from 2014, a little before the new city pop phase kicked off with the 'discovery' of 'Plastic Love' in 2017 (or 2015 if you were really on the cutting edge like me, and heard [this Dmitry from Paris mix session](https://soundcloud.com/dfp/dimitri-from-paris-live-at-slide-prince-of-wales-brixton-sep-12-2015?si=3bbc20e94a754e1f824311e04820d397&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing#t=13%3A00)).

'Crazy for you' has a rich arrangement, with plenty, horns, strings, guitar and synth to fill out the sound. It goes with the tried and tested method building of momentum through each part of the song, with the final chorus reaching delivering maximum impact.

Marina's voice is clear and powerful throughout the song, keeping up with the strong arrangement and not getting lost in the sound. The tasty post-chorus adds a bit of flair to the outro. If not for the excellent sound quality, this song could easily be mistaken for an original city pop classic, which is probably the ultimate compliment for a post-2000s city pop song.
