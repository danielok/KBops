This week we take things back in time again with a song from Lena Park release in 1998: 'These Days You... (요즘 넌...)' 
This song has some classic 90’s swinging drums and a tasty organ intro and muted trumpet outro. Effortlessly groovy. 
The song title has helped me remember the Korean word for “recently / these days” (pronounced yoo-jum)  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GduTZPYApPU">Watch on YouTube</a>
