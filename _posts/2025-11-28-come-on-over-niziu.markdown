Grab your favourite orchestra hit sample, fire up the drum machine, and set  shuffle to 11. Time for some new jack swing! NiziU (pronouced 'Needs You') is a Japanese group from K-Pop powerhouse label JYP. You can usually count on them put the bubblegum in bubblegum pop, and 'Come on Over' is delightfully upbeat track from their album 'New Emotion'. Within seconds you'll be bopping along. The arrangement changes throughout the song, keeping things interesting, while staying on a classic new jack swing footing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnWn_ljHeg4">Watch on YouTube</a>.
