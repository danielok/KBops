Apink return with an absolute masterpiece! 'Love Me More' takes a retro R&B formula, and adds stunning vocals and flute hook to create beautiful mid-temp track. The overall arrangement is very creative, with more major and minor changes than a perpetual university student. The high notes in the pre-chorus have to be heard to be believed. It also makes me think that more K-Pop songs would benefit from a flute part.
