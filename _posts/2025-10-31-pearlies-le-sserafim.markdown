Sometimes the side dish is better than the main course. This may be the case for Le Sserafim's fantastic B-side track 'Pearlies (My oyster is the world)' from their latest single release 'Spaghetti'. 

'Pearlies' steps away from the edgy tech hip-hop title track, but keeps the energy high with this punchy dance/city pop song. The vocals have great depth and rhythm, with the members showing their full range, especially with the lower notes. There's a reference their previous song 'Perfect Night' by mentioning the 'girlies'. There's also a cheeky slant rhyme of 'up tempo' with 'mental'. 

The arrangement is rich with the glistening chorus-laden guitars and mellow synths rounding out the sound. There's also the distinctive flexatone sound at the start of some of the sections to add some signature Le Sserafim quirkiness. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAAyxQb4x7Y">Watch on YouTube</a>.
