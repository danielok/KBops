Back on the indie side of things, this week we have 'Starry Night' a souful but hopeful K-city-pop track from 2019. The production from the aptly-name 'RetroMAMA' perfectly captures the melancholy city pop vibes, while keeping the main groove driving the song forward into optimism. The chord progression and bass in the chorus lines 'I just wanna say I've fallen for you' are pure distilled essence of city pop. This song is a gem, and one at least four songs in my library named 'Starry Night' stay tuned for more of them. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiKDMAxRQF8">Watch on YouTube</a>
