Set your funk-o-meter to 11 for an eXtra Large serving of groove today. This track certainly puts the 'CHILL' in 'ICHILLIN'. Not an ode to accountants' favourite productivity software (Excel) but rather refers to Extra Love, which certainly has been put into the production. This song is a nice change up from the usual up-tempo K-Pop bangers and gives you a chance to get your breath back on the dancefloor before the next high-intensity track. Bonus marks for putting 'five-star michelin malaya (you know)' in the rap, and rhyming it with 'you know I wanna'.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfHxfqKNKk4">Watch on YouTube</a>
