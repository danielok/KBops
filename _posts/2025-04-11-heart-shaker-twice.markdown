Today’s episode of K-Bops takes us back to December 2017. 'Heart Shaker' remains my favourite TWICE song and probably my favourite pure K-Pop song of all time. This song wasn't on the original version of their debut album, but was added on the re-issue. It is pure bubblegum dance-pop, with a colorful music video, including a virtual double ensemble finale.
