'Like You 100' from Gyubin is a bit more pop-rock than my usual fare, but it's such a banger, with a simple but solid rock guitar part, and sweet singer-songwriter style vocals. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07g_tnrD-sY">Watch on YouTube</a>

The pun in this title is that 100 is pronounced 'behk', so it's 'Like you back'.
