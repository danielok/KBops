Lace up your high-top sneakers and put your caps on backwards as we throw it back to 1999 for some K-Hip Hop. This song has the definition of a danceable hip hop beat, and the choreography is fantastic. Nothing says 1999 quite as much as a line in the rap that states 'cuz we Partners in rhyme through millenium times'. Unfortunately it's difficult to find high quality audio or video of the original, so definitely check out the abridged cover from Ryujin and Chaeryong from ITZY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3upBnZjW1QM">Watch on YouTube</a>
