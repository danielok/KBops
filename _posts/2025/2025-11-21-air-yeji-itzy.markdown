Time to ramp up the intensity and take down the dancefloor. ITZY's leader and vocal powerhouse, Yeji, brought out her first solo release earlier this year. 'Air' takes a deceptively simple yet strong dance/club arrangement to highlight Yeji's strong vocals. The synth in the chorus is so tasty it could be served as a side dish with Korean fried chicken. Yeji also makes a commanding statement with her powerful dance moves, especially in her high-heeled soccer boots! The English version has good vocals too. I also can't help but think that a certain very large fruit-based tech company could have used this song in the promotion for the latest model of their phone...! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TamDOXponnM">Watch on YouTube</a>.
