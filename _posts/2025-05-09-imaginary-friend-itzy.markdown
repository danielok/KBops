This week we have "Imaginary Friend" by ITZY. Their latest single is a bit more of a haunting, dramatic song—a bit of a departure from their usual upbeat style. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrUlydECU-8">Watch on YouTube</a>

Though I think this song would be better without the half a beat early snare drum every second beat. (For the record, that’s my second least favorite drum pattern—the only worse one is half a beat early snare as the first snare of the of the bar.)
