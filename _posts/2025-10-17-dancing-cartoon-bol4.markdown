Time for some feelgood dance-pop from BOL4 (pronounced bol-sa, 'sa' is the Sino-Korean pronunciation for the number 4). Formerly a duo, BOL4 has been carried forward as a solo act for Ahn Ji-young since 2020. 'Dancing Cartoon' indeed gets you dancing with its no-nonsense four on the floor beat and groovy guitar part. The vocal rhythm makes this song easy to sing along to and keeps the momentum of the song driving forwards throughout. Ahn Ji-young hits some incredibly high notes at the end of the bridge. Bonus points for the key change in the final chorus! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcwORBWKl-U">Watch on YouTube</a>.
