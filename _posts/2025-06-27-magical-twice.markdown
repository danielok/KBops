This week we've got two songs from Twice to get you set for Christmas in July. First is 'Magical' a track from the Strategy EP. This is a very cute winter song, including the line "summer's great, but when the world gets colder / that just means I get to hold you closer". The strings part in this song is excellent too. I'm going to say this is my favourite song from the EP!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKlCkB_Iicc">Watch on YouTube</a>

The second track is a holiday remix of Heart Shaker. The synth part in the intro reminds me of Toploader's version of Dancing in the Moonlight. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-_V2pDE3rU">Watch on YouTube</a>
