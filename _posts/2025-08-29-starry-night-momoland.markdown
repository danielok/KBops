Today we have the next in our series of songs titled 'Starry Night'. This track is a delightful K-City Pop song from Momoland, better known for their more upbeat hits (such as BBoom BBoom, BAAM, and Wrap Me In Plastic). This song ticks all the city pop boxes with lovely synth brass, contemplative but optimistic melody and a simple catchy chorus. Guaranteed to make you feel good this friday (or any day!) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9wtk92Ik_Q">Watch on YouTube</a>.
