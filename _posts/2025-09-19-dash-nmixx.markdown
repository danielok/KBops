Today we've got a banger by the queens of mix pop, NMIXX. 'DASH' drives forward relentlessly with a strong beat and rich instrumental production. In mix pop tradition, the bridge really takes a left turn, but steers back on track for the final chorus. Despite the moderate tempo, this song really gives you a sense of speed and would be right at home on the 'Select your car...' screen in an arcade driving game. This song does a great job of highlighting the different vocal qualities of the NMIXX singers. This song is a creative change of pace from your average K-Pop track. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UecFm_bSTU">Watch on YouTube</a>.
