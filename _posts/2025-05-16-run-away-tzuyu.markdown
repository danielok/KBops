This week we have a solo release from Tzuyu ('Chewy'), the maknae of Twice. Many of the groups have members that do solo releases in addition to their group activity, and all their members are really supportive. This song, 'Run Away' (2024) is a no-nonsense dance/pop release. To me, as an elder millenial, it feels like something Kylie Minogue would release if she was a contemporary K-Pop artist. My younger-millenial little sister mentioned that it had Dua Lipa vibes - I guess that's our age difference showing! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIrCrGAX03Y">Watch on YouTube</a>

Tzuyu, originally from Taiwan, releasing songs in Korean and English is nearly as impressive as her archery skills. Classic over-achiever!
