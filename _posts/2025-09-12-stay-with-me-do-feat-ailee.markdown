This week we have 'Stay with Me' by D.O feat Ailee, not to be confused with the Miki Matsubara's city pop classic of the same name. This one is an up-beat summer k-city pop track that will have you grooving along immediately. This one has plenty of brass in the production, throwing back to classic city pop tunes, but with even more uplifting vibes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT9roOwnKQA">Watch on YouTube</a>.
