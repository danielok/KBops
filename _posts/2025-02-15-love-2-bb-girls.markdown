Let's kick things off on the K-Bops blog with a love-themed song to celebrate the day after Valentines day. 'Love 2' by BB Girls (formerly known as Brave Girls) will bless your ears this weekend with chill Korean City Pop vibes. I see this one as the sweet follow up to their sassier song 'We Ride'. 'Love 2' talks about a bright future and the excitement of writing a new story together. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_0oh_RoGcw">Watch on YouTube</a>
