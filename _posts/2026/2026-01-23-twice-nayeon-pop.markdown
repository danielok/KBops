Today we have 'POP!', the 2022 solo debut from Twice's ultimate unnie: Nayeon. This appropriately-titled track puts the 'pop' in 'K-pop', with its upbeat tempo and catchy chorus. It's easy to see why this was such a successful release from Twice's first solo project. Nayeon is known for her strong vocals and certainly carries that into this song. While arrangement is straightforward, allowing Nayeon's singing to take centre stage, the horns and bass add some colour to the mix. The music video is appropriately saturated and cutesy, with a nod to classic k-pop MVs of old. The song is from her debut EP titled 'Im Nayeon' a subtle play on words, since her surname is 'Im'.
