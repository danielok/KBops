Well, 2025 is wrapping up, and there have been so many fantastic songs released this year. I thought I'd have a shot at listing my favourite 5, as well as some favourite throwback tracks that have featured the blog this year.

## 1. Love 2 - BB Girls

This magical k-city pop song has been my top played track on YT Music this year, for good reason. Its sweet, sombre and optimistic vibe blesses my ears every time I listen to it

## 2. Different - LE SSERAFIM

## 3. ShaLaLa - SAYMYNAME

## 4. I want you - SMORZ

## 5. This is For - TWICE

## Honerable Mention: Be Alright - IVE

## Older Tracks

* Off the record - IVE
* Green light - BoA
