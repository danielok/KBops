As teased two weeks ago, we have “Different” from Le Sserafim. A bit of a change up from their usual style, this one lowers the tempo and raises the groove. Strong drums, bright guitars and a brass section make this a funk masterpiece. Arachnophobia warning for the music video though. <a href="https://youtu.be/HFZUAXhdnHk?si=mzPD7o7o0Oc2mLfG">Watch on YouTube</a>

Many people have mentioned that this is the most Rogers-like track in K-pop even though Nile Rogers didn’t work on it. He previously worked on their song 'Unfogiven'. 

Bonus Nile Rogers fact for this week: Did you know Nile Rogers did the Halo game soundtracks?

Did you also know Cory Wong’s band did a cover?  <a href="https://youtu.be/Xc2qr9C0PRE">Watch on YouTube</a>
