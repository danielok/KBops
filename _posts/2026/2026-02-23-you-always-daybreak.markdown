This week we have a mellow but bright K City Pop track: 'You Always'. Specifically the cover by Daybreak from 2018.

Lovely arrangement here with lots of rich sounds, including brass, synths and clean guitar with an overall 1990s vibe.

Also check out the original by Mono, and another cover by Kim Areum.
