'Off the record' by IVE is hard to describe, but is an absolutely fantastic track. Soft funky pop vibes with a solid beat, mellow vocals and a dash of City Pop. You just have to listen to it. My only nitpick here is they missed the opportunity to rhyme 'condensation' with 'conversation' in the rap. There's also a 'Lovefool' by Cardigans reference in the bridge. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ApV7Lm87cg">Watch on YouTube</a>
