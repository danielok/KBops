Today's song is 'ShaLala' by Say My Name, a lovely follow up to their original single 'WaveWay'. This song has a delightful City Pop / synth pop vibes with a hip hop second verse. The choreography is so cutesy and sweet you’ll need to visit the dentist afterwards. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPEfIvfmCxM">Watch on YouTube</a>
