Back in 1997 SES arrived on the scene with this absolute banger. 'I'm Your Girl' is the title track from their first album, as is a classic fusion of K-Pop and New Jack Swing. It's got a rap intro and break, shuffled drums, sparkling synths and a juicy key change in the final chorus. SES delivers this one with powerful vocals (especially the end of the bridge and in the final chorus), and it's easy to see you this song kicked off many successful years for them. The music video has all the key features of a 1990s MV - over-exposed lighting, high colour saturation, weird angles, and extremely zoomed in shots. It's a must see!
