The latest album from Misamo (Twice's Japanese subunit of Mina, Sana and Momo) features solo tracks from each member. Sana's song, 'Ma Cherry' answers two important questions: 1. Can Sana rap? 2. What is the maximum tasteful amount of orchestra hits in a K-pop song?

'Ma Cherry' has quite a distinctive arrangement in the world of Twice and Misamo. It has an underlying jungle break drum loop, with some understated synths coming and going throughout the verses. The start of the chorus ramps things up with a tasty dose of orchestra hits, and richer instrumentation complements the second half.

This track is short but sweet, and oh so catchy!
