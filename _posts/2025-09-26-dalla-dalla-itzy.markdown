This week we wind the clock back a few years to ITZY's debut single 'Dalla Dalla' (translates to 'different, different'). Back in 2019 they certainly hit the scene with a bang. 'Dalla Dalla' is powerful k-pop track, with an unbeatably high energy chorus. Now, whenever I hear a lift 'ding' sound effect I'm ready to break out into song. ITZY have recently signed an extension to their contract, I'm keen to see what gems their new Japan release 'Collector' will contain. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNfTK39k55U">Watch on YouTube</a>.
